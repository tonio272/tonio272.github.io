    <p style="height: 20px;">I am a graduate student at the Department of Urban
      Studies and Planning at MIT. I was born and raised in Mexico, where I
      worked as a policy analyst after finishing college. Since my background is
      in International Relations and Policy, my specialization at DUSP is in
      International Development. However, I am also interested in GIS analysis,
      data visualization, economics and development as a means to prevent
      violence. I will be graduating this summer, with a thesis analyzing
      spatial patterns of violence prevention and protection strategies in
      cities in Northern Mexico.</p>

    <p style="height: 20px;">One of my favorite visualizations is the Racial Dot
      Map, which shows an approximation of where each person lives in the United
      States and can be symbolized to show their race. This provides a glance at
      segregation in American cities.</p>
